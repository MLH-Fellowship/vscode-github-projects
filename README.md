In one sentence: A VS Code extension that brings GitHub's projects into VS Code.

How did I make this repository?  You know.

Step 1: npm install -g yo generator-code
Step 2: yo code (it'll ask you a bunch of questions.  Scroll with the arrow keys!)

What did I select?

I selected **New Extension (TypeScript)**, **vscode-github-projects** as the extension name, vscode-github-projects as the extension identifier, I did set specific description text which you can see in package.json "description".

I said Yes to initialize a git repository, No to "bundle the source code with webpack", and **npm** as the package manager to use.

Currently I just registered a test warning message in extension.js, and in package.json I added the message to **activationEvents** and **contributes/commands**.

How to run in VS Code?  fn + F5 to open a new Extension Development Host window.

âŒ˜ + Shift + P to get Command Palette, in which we can do **Developer: Reload Window** to get saved changes, OR commands such as **Hello World**.
